# VidNote
A video annotation cross-platform application. Annotations can be audio, text, or even video annotations. Work in progress.

## Usage Instructions

Since the project is still a work in progress, it hasn't been packaged for easy installation. Trying out the unfinished project requires building it yourself from the source files. 

#### Installing node and npm
First make sure you have node and npm (node package manager) installed. You can check this by trying to run `node -v` and `npm -v` in your cli.

If they're not installed follow the instructions on the nodejs website http://nodejs.org .

#### Cloning the repo
Then clone the VidNote repo using git-cli to your working directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/RamiAwar/VidNote
```

#### Installing release and development node packages
After that you are ready to build the project. Navigate to the project directory (VidNote/) and run `npm install` to install all the release and development node packages. This should take a couple of minutes.
